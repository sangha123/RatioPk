RatioPk
=======

This code calculates the ratio of the power spectrum between halofit (http://camb.info) and Cosmic Emulator (http://www.lanl.gov/projects/cosmology/CosmicEmu/index.html)
 The x co-ordinates of the outputs of the two codes are different, hence it uses scipy.interpolate to get the ratio for the same x-co-ordinates.
